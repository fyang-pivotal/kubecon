## morning session: networking deep dive
- CNI allows pods to communicate to each other
  - iptables, cloud network, etc
- namespace
  - `NetworkPolicy` specify ingress-deny-all
  - matchLabels key: val store
  - reference a subset of the namespace
- endpoints
  - two set of abstractions
    - list of all ips
    - pod healthcheck (iff ready available in endpoints)
  - two lists in endpoints (ready and not ready)
- service
  - feeds into endpoints via a loadbalancer 
  - 4 different kinds of services
    - typeExternal
    - clusterIP
      - internal loadBalancer
    - nodePort
      - exposes
    - loadBalancer
- podReadyState
  - at the networking layer instead of the local layer
- `kubeproxy`
- DNS controller
- Ingress define http backend and tied them to `svc`
- roadmap
  - ingress GA
  - multicluster networking
- deepdive
  - endpoint slice
    - for resolving large clusters with many endpoints
    - endpoint is 1:1 to service. endpoint slice requires label mapping
    - ready boolean
    - migration of Endpoint to Endpoint slices for API resources
  - ingress

## afternoon session: clusterAPI deep dive
- what is clusterAPI? a declarative manifest to manage k8s clusters
  - ecosystem is fragmented
  - clusterAPI used to build on top
- visualization
  - use k8s cluster to run k8s cluster
  - given a declarative spec for k8s cluster
  - manage k8s on any cloud
    - vSphere, GCP, Azure
- k8s API on top of boostraping, including `kubeadm`, `talos`
- build a framework or foundation
  - support advance use cases
- version `v1alpha2`
  - infra CRDs
  - management cluster (control plane)
  - target cluster (lifecycle of cluster to be managed)
  - cluster CRD
    - kind: `Cluster`, spec `infrastructureRef`
    - `kind: AWSCluster`
  - machine CRD
    - kind: `Machine`, bootstrap:
    - kind: `AWSMachine`
    - `e3` instance type
  - boostrapConfig CRD
    - kubeadmConfig
    - used by the bootstrap provider to generate metadata, cluster config
    - configure the control plane of your target cluster
  - `MachineDeployment`
    - use it to manage worker machines for now; control plane machine coming
      soon
  - Architecture
- roadmap
  - clusterctl v2
  - control plane management
  - machinepool
  - failure domain for spreading machines across AZs
- planned features
  - node remediation
  - testing framework (e2e tests)
  - validation webhooks (configuration errors, force immutability)
  - load balancer providers
