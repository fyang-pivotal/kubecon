    - distributed client libraries
  - diverge per languages
    - rebuild, re-qualify
  - Rejected alternative
    - remote services, DLLs, Foreigh Function Interfaces
  - Goal: roll out side car to millions of processes keep it up-to-date
    - start with enabling sidecars using opt-in
    - new languages and functionality-
      - best customers are ones with something to gain
    - warn ALL users beforehand; be proactive
    - take it slow
      - cluster by cluster opt-in
  - Upgrades?
    - dev/stable; weekly/monthly
    - test against dev vs. test against stable
    - automatic happens on restart; bound;
    - no automatic changes allowed; get the latest when the binary is rebuild;
  - Lessons
    - App <-> sidecar communication; use tried-n-true tech like
      unix-domain-socket
    - Acceptable perf hit; continuous improvement
    - Default behavior; avoid the unexpected; guard new functionality with
      opt-in and opt-out
    - Don't get fancy: no hot-restart - no more crashing than kernel; shared
      fate b/t sidecar and app;
  - Totally worth it
    - security fix; roll out automatic to thousands of applications
- Daniel Berg; Istio 1.4
  - Istio Operator
  - istioctl add-to-mesh

- Alejandro@buoyant admission webhooks
  - Slidecar proxy injection in LinkerD
  - API requests trigger:
    - Mutation admission and validation admission
    - Mutating admission webhooks
      - Inject sidecar injector
      - Validating admission: resource quota
    - sidecar without mem limit
- NSM; Network service mesh; cisco + vmware;
- Luke Kysow; Hashicorp;
  - consul: https://github.com/hashicorp/consul
  - inject side-car; migration from AWS to GKE

## Afternoon Sessions
- Christian Posta; solo.io
  - challenges of options
  - start with service mesh
    - start at the edge
    - data plane vs. control plane
  - the truth of service mesh
    - goal: "sm gives a nice API into app networking"
    - use it in the code
      - cannot use sidecar proxy
      - need performance in the data plane
    - use it as a sidecar proxy
      - cannot modify the application
      - watchs out for:
        - race conditions when starting alongside app
        - leaky abstractions
      - example: LinkerD
    - implement as a shared domain gateway
      - decoupling of API
      - istio supports both architectures
    - implement as a central gateway
      - just starting out
      - challenges: noisy neighbor
  - unified data plane API: CNCF project
  - webassembly
    - envoy-wasm; gloo.solo.io
    - demo
- Michelle Norabli; Helm; Msft;
  - CNCF: Kubecon 2017; Austin; ServiceMesh
  - What end users want
    - deployment strategies: canery; blue/green
  - SMI (servicemesh interface)
    - spec: traffic split
    - each spec is a CRD
    - weight: similar to Consul; % of traffic routed to svc
    - SMI SDK
      - examples imported as libraries
    - traffic policy overview
  - terrible presentation
- Idit Levine; solo.io; auto-pilot
- Weaveworks [Flagger](https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger)
  - Deployment strategies
    - canary
    - A/B
    - blue/green
    - traffic mirroring
  - flagger makes canary deployment automatic
    - CRD; requires promethesus; get metrics
    - canary time and step interval; shift from primary to canary;
    - 50% metrics of what success looks like
  - use webhook to generate traffic, sample traffic, mirror traffic
  - Helm charts; progressive delivery; flux;
- Sean Suchter; Istio adoption journey; google
  - mTLS; auto-generation and rotation of certificates
  - rBAC ingress blocking
  - Istio filtering
  - redundancy: Istio supports multi-cluster; different geos;
  - canary deployments
  - intrusion detection
  - Istio integration; ecosystem of different vendors enabling network-level integration; WASM multi-language code;
  - Telemetry from Istion (mixer v2)
- mental model of servicemesh
  - monolith; load-balancer; scalability; database layer
  - connect to blackbox; exchange data; 3rd party
  - do we have already have one?
    - managing change across the servicemesh
    - microservice: everything you need to touch to rollout change
  - servicemesh not service mess!
  - three components:
    1. control plane
      - separate config logically; distinct config stores must be reconciled
    1. multi-cluster
      - scale compute; HA; distinct compute env
      - best practice: respect namespace; same namespace with same name means
        same service
      - mTLS is a must because comm. happens over public internet
  - A cluster is a context for compute
  - Multi-mesh across multi-cluster
    - only identity is shared; sharing trust;
